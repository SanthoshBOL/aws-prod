# üöÄ AWS Full VPC Project Documentation

## üß† About the Project

This is a real-world hands-on project to build a secure, scalable AWS infrastructure. The goal is to host a sample webpage using private EC2 instances and expose it to the internet using a Load Balancer. The setup uses multiple Availability Zones, private/public subnets, NAT Gateways, Auto Scaling Groups, and a Jump Host for secure access.

This kind of architecture is often used in production-level deployments to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and security.

## üß∞ What Was Used

* Custom VPC with custom IP range
* 2 Availability Zones (AZ A and AZ B)
* 2 Public subnets (one per AZ)
* 2 Private subnets (one per AZ)
* 2 NAT Gateways (placed in public subnets)
* Launch Template + Auto Scaling Group
* EC2 instances (2 private, 1 jump host public)
* Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* Python web server (SimpleHTTPServer)

---

## üî® Let‚Äôs Create It

### üî∏ VPC Creation

* Created a VPC with a custom IP range.
* Inside the VPC:

  * AZ A:

    * 1 Public Subnet
    * 1 Private Subnet
  * AZ B:

    * 1 Public Subnet
    * 1 Private Subnet
* Created 1 NAT Gateway in each public subnet (1 for each AZ).

### üî∏ Launch Template & Auto Scaling Group

* Created a **Launch Template** with a basic Ubuntu AMI and default instance configuration.

![](aws-prod-example-images/15.png)

* Created an **Auto Scaling Group** using that template:

  * Minimum and desired capacity set to 2 instances
  * Spread across AZ A and AZ B
  * Launched 1 EC2 in each AZ
  * These EC2s are placed inside **private subnets**, so they don‚Äôt have public IPs

## üîê Setting Up Jump Host

Since the private EC2 instances have no public IP, we can‚Äôt SSH into them directly. So we use a **Jump Host (Bastion Host)**:

* Created a new EC2 instance in the **public subnet** of the same VPC
* Allowed **port 22 (SSH)** in its Security Group

![](aws-prod-example-images/18.png)
![](aws-prod-example-images/19.png)

* Used the command below to copy my `.pem` file to the jump host:

```bash
scp -i /Users/santhoshkumarchintada/Downloads/aws-login.pem \
/Users/santhoshkumarchintada/Downloads/aws-login.pem \
ubuntu@13.61.142.208:/home/ubuntu
```

![](aws-prod-example-images/20.png)

* Then SSH‚Äôd into the Jump Host:

```bash
ssh -i aws-login.pem ubuntu@13.61.142.208
```

![](aws-prod-example-images/1.png)

* From there, used the copied key to connect to the private EC2s (successfully ‚úÖ)

---

## üåê Web Server on Private EC2

* Logged into the EC2 in **AZ A** and started a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

![](aws-prod-example-images/3.png)

* This server was **not deployed** on AZ B intentionally to simulate a failed target.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Creating the Load Balancer

* Created an **Application Load Balancer**:

![](aws-prod-example-images/4.png)

* Selected the same VPC
* Selected both AZs and their subnets
* Created a new **Target Group**

![](aws-prod-example-images/5.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixing Port 80 Issue

Initially, ALB couldn't reach port 80 on the private EC2s. The fix:

* Updated **Security Group** to allow inbound traffic on port 80
* Now both EC2s became reachable

![](aws-prod-example-images/7.png)

* Added both EC2 instances from the Auto Scaling Group
* Configured **health check** on port 80 and path `/`

Accessed the ALB URL:

```
http://aws-prod-example-375681940.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

![](aws-prod-example-images/8.png)

### Result:

* Even though AZ B has no server, the page **always worked** ‚úÖ
* Why? Because the Load Balancer‚Äôs health check detected only AZ A is healthy and routed traffic there

---

## üß† Why Load Balancer Worked Even When AZ B Had No Page?

This is due to the **health check mechanism**:

* ALB checks whether each EC2 instance responds correctly to a specific path/port
* If a target fails, ALB **removes it from rotation**
* Only healthy targets get traffic ‚Äî that‚Äôs why the page kept loading from AZ A

![](aws-prod-example-images/9.png)

---

## üß™ Testing with Second Instance (AZ B)

* Deployed the same Python web server on the EC2 in AZ B:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

![](aws-prod-example-images/10.png)

* Health check passed ‚úÖ for both EC2s

![](aws-prod-example-images/11.png)

* Accessed ALB URL again ‚Äî now it started rotating traffic between AZ A and AZ B

**Verified by observing:**

* Some requests responded from Server 1 (AZ A)

![](aws-prod-example-images/8.png)

* Others from Server 2 (AZ B)

---

## üéâ Success

* Fully functional infrastructure with:

  * Secure private EC2s
  * Jump host access
  * Auto Scaling Group
  * Load Balancer with smart health checks
* Demonstrated real-world production flow ‚úÖ

---

## üìå Notes

* You can turn off health checks to force ALB to route to all instances, even broken ones (not recommended)
* This simulates how real-world infrastructure reroutes traffic from failed servers to healthy ones
* Use this flow as a base for CI/CD, container deployments, or monitoring stack setups
